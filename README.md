# SpaceFlight Simulator Tools
 Made to help SpaceFlight Simulator players use and understand more advanced features of the game that need file editing


# Help Development
 I didn't and still don't have a good wiki to look at for SFS so if you notice that some part names are misspelled in the json result or there are errors with the output add an issue


# Features

## Current
- [x] Adding parts via the form
- [x] Removing parts
- [x] Edit part values via forms  
- [x] All parts? I think (Add an issue if not)

## Coming (Maybe if I can)
- [ ] Visual editor
